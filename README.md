YOLOv3: Object Detection in Real-Time Video Stream
This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) for real-time object detection in video streams. YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model known for its balance between speed and accuracy in detecting objects within images and videos.

Key Features
Real-Time Detection: Processes video frames quickly enough for real-time applications.
Multi-Class Detection: Detects multiple objects from a predefined set of classes (e.g., people, vehicles, animals).
High Accuracy: Provides accurate object localization and classification in each frame.
How It Works
Load the Model: The YOLOv3 model is loaded using pre-trained weights and configuration files. These files define the architecture and parameters of the model.

Prepare Video Stream: Captures frames from a video source (e.g., webcam, video file) for processing.

Preprocess the Frame: Each frame is resized and normalized to fit the input requirements of the YOLOv3 model.

Run Detection: The preprocessed frame is passed through the YOLOv3 network to obtain bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores for detected objects.

Postprocess and Display: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labels, and the processed frame is displayed in a window to show real-time results.

Handle Output: Continuously processes video frames and updates the display until the user stops the stream.

Requirements
Python: Programming language used for the project.
OpenCV: Library for video capture, image processing, and display.
